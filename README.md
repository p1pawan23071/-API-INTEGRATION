*DESCRIPTION*: A weather information website is a practical web application that displays current and forecasted weather conditions by integrating with public weather APIs. The implementation requires careful planning of frontend components and API integration strategies.

Frontend Components The website should have a clean, responsive UI with:

Location search functionality
Current weather display (temperature, conditions, humidity, wind)
Forecast section (daily/hourly predictions)
Interactive elements (unit toggles, refresh buttons)
Visual representations (weather icons, charts)
API Integration Strategy The website connects to public weather APIs like OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI. These RESTful APIs provide JSON responses containing weather data. The integration process involves:

API Key Registration:

Developer accounts provide authentication keys
Keys must be secured and not exposed in client-side code
Endpoint Selection:

Current weather endpoint (/weather)
Forecast endpoint (/forecast)
Geolocation endpoint for automatic detection
Request Patterns:

Fetch API or Axios for making HTTP requests
Proper error handling for failed requests
Loading states during data fetching
Implementation Files

index.html:

Contains the basic HTML structure
Includes meta tags for responsiveness
Links to CSS and JS files
Defines the UI skeleton with semantic HTML
Should include containers for all weather components
styles.css:

Handles responsive layouts for all screen sizes
Implements weather condition-based theming (css variables)
Includes styling for cards, buttons, and forms
Animation classes for smooth transitions
Typography and spacing rules
app.js:

Main application logic and API interactions
Event listeners for user interactions
Data fetching functions with error handling
DOM manipulation functions
Unit conversion utilities
Local storage for preferences caching
Implementation Process

Setup:

Create project directory with the three core files
Initialize any needed dependencies (moment.js for dates, etc.)
UI Development:

Build search interface and results containers
Design weather condition cards
Implement responsive grids for forecasts
API Integration:

Configure API endpoint constants
Write fetch functions with query parameters
Parse JSON responses into usable data
Data Presentation:

Create DOM element generators
Map weather codes to appropriate icons
Format temperatures and other metrics
